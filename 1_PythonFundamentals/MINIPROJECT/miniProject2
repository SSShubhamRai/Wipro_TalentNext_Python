# 2.Let's assume you are planning to use your python skills to build an App for Mobile.
# You decide to host your application on servers running in the cloud. you pick a hosting provider that charges $0.51 per hour. you will launch your services using one server and want to know how much it will cost to operate per day, per week, per month.
# Write a python program that displays the answers to the following questions:
# How much does it cost to operate one server per day?
# How much does it cost to operate one server per week?
# How much does it cost to operate one server per month?
# How much days can I operate one server with $918? Do all this
rate_per_hour = 0.51
per_day = rate_per_hour * 24
per_week = per_day * 7
per_month = per_day * 30
budget = 918
days_operated = budget / per_day

print(f"Cost per day: ${per_day:.2f}")
print(f"Cost per week: ${per_week:.2f}")
print(f"Cost per month: ${per_month:.2f}")
print(f"You can operate one server for {int(days_operated)} days with $918")
